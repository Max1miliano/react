<h1>Welcome to my first project on React</h1>

<h2>I am very happy with my results in terms of functionality, although I know that the improvement process is constant and gradual. Same with styles.</h2>

## About the project

The objective is to create a system that easily allows the publication of products, stock control and order generation.

The steps are the following:
* On the main page you will find the total number of products listed by the owner
* The user can go to a detail page and load the amount of products they want into the cart
* Once the purchase is finished, when continuing, a form will open to be able to enter the necessary data for the creation of the order that will be saved in a database.

### Libraries and tools used

* I found it very useful to use the Chakra UI library as it allows me to reduce the CSS files and apply directly imported styles.
* I also used a NoSQL database like Firebase to store my created orders, products and categories.
